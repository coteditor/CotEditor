Contributing Guidelines
==========================

General Feedback
--------------------------

Create a new issue on our [Issues page](https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor/issues). You can write your feedback either in English (recommended) or in Japanese.


### Bug reports

Search for existing issues first. If you find your issue previously reported, post your case to that issue; otherwise, create a new one by filling up the "Bug report" template. Do not hesitate to post the same phenomenon to the existing issue as long as the cases are less than 10. Multiple instances help a lot to find out the cause. In that situation, include your environment (versions of both CotEditor and macOS) in your post.

If possible, attach screenshots/screencasts of the issue you face. It is also helpful to attach sample files that can reproduce the issue.

If your issue relates to the syntax highlight, include the sample code that can reproduce the unwanted highlight in your post.


### Feature requests

Search for existing requests first. If you find your feature previously requested, post your comment to that issue; otherwise, create a new one by filling up the "Feature request" template.
Create an issue per feature instead of listing multiple features on one issue page.



Pull-Request
--------------------------

### General Code Improvements

Bug fixes and improvements are welcome. If you want to add a new feature or the change is huge, it's better at first to ask the team whether your idea will be accepted.

By adding code, please follow our coding style guide below.


### Localization

Fixing/updating existing localizations is always welcome. The project team adds `FIXME:` tag as a comment in the localized strings files if there are updated strings to be localized.

If your localization makes the Autolayout destroy, try first making the sentence shorter. However, if it's impossible, then just tell us about it with a screenshot when you make a pull-request. We'll update the storyboard file to layout your localized terms correctly.

#### Good references for localization

By localization, use macOS standard terms. It might be helpful to study native Apple applications like TextEdit.app or System Settings to know how Apple localizes terms in their apps.

Especially, follow the terms of the following applications.

- Menu item titles in TextEdit.app
- Find panel in Pages.app
- Some setting messages in ScriptEditor.app

We recommend to utilize [Apple Localization Terms Glossary for macOS](https://applelocalization.com/macos) by Kishikawa Katsumi to find macOS-friendly expressions. This service enables us to search in the texts localized by Apple for macOS applications and frameworks.
You also need to take care of how Apple treats punctuation characters and symbols. For example, regarding quotation marks, they normally prefer the typographer's ones.


#### Submitting a new localization

Copy one of a whole .lproj directory and use it as a template. We recommend using `CotEditor/en-GB.lproj/` directory because they are always up-to-date.
Note that you don't need to localize the Unicode block names in the `UnicodeUnicode.strings` file.

Continuous maintenance of the localization is highly recommended when providing a new localization. Please tell us if you also intend to be a localization maintainer when submitting a new localization. When we have new strings to be localized, we call the localization maintainers by creating an issue with the `@` mention on GitHub so that they can keep all their localized strings up to date.
Currently, we already have maintainers for:

- Japanese
- Simplified Chinese
- Traditional Chinese
- Italian
- French
- Portuguese
- Turkish
- English (UK)

#### Localization for the App Store

CotEditor project is also asking for localization of description on the Mac App Store. We have a separate repository for it at [coteditor/Documents-for-AppStore](https://github.com/coteditor/Documents-for-AppStore).


### Syntaxes

#### Adding a new bundled syntax

Put just your new syntax into `/CotEditor/syntaxes/` directory. You don't need to modify `SyntaxMap.json` file. It's generated automatically on the build.

The license for the bundled syntaxes must be "Same as CotEditor".

If the syntax language is relatively minor, we recommend you not to bundle it to CotEditor but to distribute it as an additional syntax in your own way, and just add a link to our [wiki page](https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor/wiki/Additional-Syntax-Styles).


### Themes

We don't accept pull requests adding bundled themes at the moment. You can distribute yours as an additional theme in your own way, and add a link to our [wiki page](https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor/wiki/Additional-Themes).


### Graphics Resources

We don't accept pull requests for image resources. [1024jp](https://github.com/1024jp) enjoys creating and brushing up the graphics ;). Please just point out on the Issues page if a graphic resource has some kind of mistake to be fixed.


Coding Style Guide
--------------------------

Please follow the style of the existing codes in CotEditor.

- Respect the existing coding style.
- Leave reasonable comments.
- Never omit `self` except in `willSet`/`didSet`.
- Add `final` to classes by default.
- Insert a blank line after class/function statement line.
    ```Swift
    /// say moof.
    func moof() {
        
        print("moof")
    }
    ```
- Don't declare `@IBOutlet` properties with `!`.
    ```Swift
    // OK
    @IBOutlet private weak var button: NSButton?
    
    // NG
    @IBOutlet private weak var button: NSButton!
    ```
- Write the `guard` statement in one-line if just return a simple value.
    ```Swift
    // prefer
    guard !foo.isEmpty else { return nil }
    
    // instead of
    guard !foo.isEmpty else {
        return nil
    }
    ```
