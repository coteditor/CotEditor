CotEditor is an excellent foundation for a note-taking application because:

1. **Native macOS Integration** - Follows Apple's design guidelines
2. **Mature Text Engine** - Built on NSTextView with robust text handling
3. **Syntax Highlighting** - Already supports Markdown syntax
4. **File Management** - Document-based architecture
5. **Extensible** - Well-structured Swift codebase
