<h1>Script CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>CotEditor includes a scripting feature that lets you run scripts in CotEditor to process documents or launch external tools. Your scripts appear in the Script menu represented with <object type="image/svg+xml" data="../../Shared/gfx/script.svg" height="14">script icon</object>.</p>

<h2>Scripting types</h2>
<p>On CotEditor, there are two different ways to write scripts:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>AppleScript</dt>
	<dd>AppleScript (incl. JXA; JavaScript for Automation) can control documents in CotEditor with a high level of flexibility.</dd>
	
	<dt>UNIX script</dt>
	<dd>UNIX scripts can modify only the frontmost document, but you can write them in various languages such as Python, Ruby, and Swift.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Choose the scripting type that suits your needs. For details about how to write your scripts, see <a href="script_osascript.html">Script CotEditor with AppleScript</a> or <a href="script_unixscript.html">Script CotEditor with UNIX script</a>.</p>


<h2>Add or delete scripts</h2>

<p>To add scripts to or remove scripts from the Script menu, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose Script &gt; Open Scripts Folder in CotEditor. The Finder opens the folder for CotEditor scripts at:<br/>
	~/Library/Application Scripts/com.coteditor.CotEditor/</li>
	<li>Put your script files in this folder, or remove unwanted ones.</li>
	<li>Changes to this folder are applied automatically to the Script menu.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also change the order of scripts or assign keyboard shortcuts by modifying the names of your script files. See <a href="script_menu.html">Customize the Script menu</a> for the details.</p>
