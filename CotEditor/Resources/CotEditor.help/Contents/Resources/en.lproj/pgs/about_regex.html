<h1>Use regular expressions in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>In CotEditor, you can use regular expression patterns in features such as Find and Replace and line sorting to define more flexible matching conditions. Regular expressions are also used to specify rules for syntax highlighting and outline extraction.</p>

<p>Regular expressions are a notation for describing specific text patterns when searching for or replacing text. They are used in many programming languages and tools, and allow flexible text processing. For example, the regular expression pattern “dog|cow” matches either “dog” or “cow”.</p>

<p>There are several implementations of regular expressions; while the basic syntax is similar, the supported features and detailed behavior can vary between implementations. CotEditor uses an ICU-compatible library for regular expressions. For details about the regular expression syntax, see the <a href="https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/strings/regexp.html" title="Regular Expressions - ICU Documentation" rel="external">ICU Regular Expressions Guide</a>.</p>

<p>You can also customize detailed behaviors when performing regular expression searches and replacements. For more information about customization options, see <a href="howto_find.html">Find and replace text</a>.</p>
