<h1>Define delimiters in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>In CotEditor, you can configure how comment and other delimiters are handled for each syntax. These settings affect not only comment commands but also regular-expression-based syntax highlighting and paired-symbol matching in the editor.</p>

<p>To define delimiters for a syntax, select Delimiters in the list on the left side of the syntax editor, then configure options on the right. See <a href="syntax_definition.html">Define a syntax</a> for how to open the syntax editor.</p>


<section>
<h2>Define comment delimiters</h2>

<p>The following comment settings are used for the Comment Out and Uncomment commands. In regular-expression-based syntax definitions, they are also used for comment highlighting.</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr><th>Inline comment</th><td><p>Text from the specified delimiter to the end of the line is treated as an inline comment.</p></td></tr>
		<tr><th>Block comment</th><td><p>Text enclosed by the specified begin and end delimiters is treated as a block comment. You need to enter both Begin String and End String.</p></td></tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>In the standard Comment Out command, inline comment delimiters are preferred when both inline and block comment delimiters are defined. If multiple delimiters are defined, the first one is used.</p>
</section>


<section>
<h2>Escape delimiters</h2>

<p>Choose how CotEditor escapes delimiters in a document. This setting is used for regular-expression-based syntax highlighting and for matching paired symbols in the editor.</p>

<table>
<thead>
	<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th>Delimiter escape style</th>
		<td><p>The style applied to begin/end delimiter pairs.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><em>Backslash</em>: Treat a backslash (&#x005C;) as an escape character. A delimiter immediately preceded by a backslash is ignored.</li>
				<li><em>None</em>: Do not treat any character as an escape. Every delimiter is matched.</li>
			</ul></td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>For example, if the escape style is Backslash and the string delimiter is <code>&quot;</code>, a sequence like <code>\&quot;</code> does not end the string.</p>
