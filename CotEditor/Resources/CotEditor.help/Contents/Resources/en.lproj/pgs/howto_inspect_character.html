<h1>Get information about a character in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>CotEditor can inspect the Unicode information about the selected character.</p>

<p>The Character Inspector shows a zoomed view of the selected character, its Unicode code point, Unicode name, Unicode block name, Unicode category, and the Unicode version in which the character was introduced. If the selected character is actually composed of multiple Unicode characters, information for each constituent character appears.</p>
