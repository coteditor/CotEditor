<h1>Get information about a character in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>CotEditor can inspect the information about the selected character.</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>In the CotEditor app <img class="appicon" srcset="../../Shared/gfx/icon_32x32@2x.png 2x" alt=""/> on your Mac, select exactly a single character.</p></li>
	<li><p>Choose Text &gt; Inspect Character.</p></li>
</ol>

</figure>

<p>The inspector shows: the character in close-up, the Unicode code point, the Unicode character name, block name, general category, and the Unicode version that introduced the character. It also shows the UTF-16 codepoints of each character in braces if the character is a surrogate pair. If the selected letter consists actually of multiple Unicode characters, only the code points and Unicode names appear.</p>
<p>Clicking on a block name in the inspector switches between the localized block name and the block name defined in Unicode.</p>
