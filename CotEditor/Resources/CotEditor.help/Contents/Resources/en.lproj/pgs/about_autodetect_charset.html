<h1>Use encoding declarations for encoding detection in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>When the “Refer to encoding declaration in document” option in the Format settings is selected, CotEditor checks for encoding declarations when opening a file. The following declaration forms are recognized if present: <code>charset=</code>, <code>encoding=</code>, <code>@charset</code>, <code>encoding:</code> and <code>coding:</code>. If one of these declarations is written properly, CotEditor uses it to determine the file’s text encoding.</p>
<p>A declaration can appear anywhere in the document. CotEditor detects it whether it is inside a comment or written as plain text. If you need to include wording such as “charset=UTF-8” even though the document is not actually encoded in UTF-8, either place the correct encoding declaration before that phrase or turn off the “Refer to encoding declaration in document” option.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The scope to scan declarations is limited to 2,000 characters from the head of the document.</li>
	<li>To make the detection of declarations work, you have to put an equal sign (“=”, no other characters) right after “<code>charset</code>” or “<code>encoding</code>.”</li>
	<li>The encoding name which comes after “<code>charset=</code>” or “<code>encoding=</code>” can be without double-quotes (&quot;) around.</li>
	<li>In the case there are multiple encoding declarations in your document, CotEditor uses the first one to determine the text encoding.</li>
</ul>
