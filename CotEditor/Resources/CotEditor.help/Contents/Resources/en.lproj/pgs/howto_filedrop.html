<h1>Drop files to editor in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>File Drop is the feature to insert custom text based on the files dropped to the editor. For example, you can automatically insert the <code>img</code> tag into your HTML document by dropping an image file from the Finder.</p>

<h2>Insert a snippet by dropping files</h2>

<p>Drop files to the point to insert in the editor in the CotEditor app <img class="appicon" srcset="../../Shared/gfx/icon_32x32@2x.png 2x" alt=""/> on your Mac.</p>

<p>You need to set the rule of the text to be inserted in advance. When no rule for the dropped file is found, the full path of the file is inserted.</p>
