<h1>Normalize Unicode text in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>Unicode normalization lets you convert text into a consistent Unicode form. In CotEditor, you can normalize the text in a document using various Unicode normalization methods.</p>

<p>Unicode normalization is the process of converting text into a standardized Unicode representation. In Unicode text, characters that look the same can sometimes be represented by different Unicode sequences, and normalization helps eliminate those differences.</p>

<p>CotEditor supports the following Unicode normalization forms:</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Form</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>NFD</th>
			<td><p>Canonical decomposition.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>NFC</th>
			<td><p>Canonical decomposition, followed by canonical composition.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>NFKD</th>
			<td><p>Compatibility decomposition.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>NFKC</th>
			<td><p>Compatibility decomposition, followed by canonical composition.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>NFKC Case-Fold</th>
			<td><p>Applying NFKC, case folding, and removal of default-ignorable code points.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Modified NFD</th>
			<td><p>Unofficial NFD-based normalization form used in HFS+.</p></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Modified NFC</th>
			<td><p>Unofficial NFC-based normalization form corresponding to Modified NFD.</p></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p><em class="note">Note:</em> Modified NFD and Modified NFC follow the modified Unicode normalization used by macOS file systems, such as HFS+, where file names are normalized using a variant of Unicode normalization. It is useful when working with text derived from macOS file names.</p>
