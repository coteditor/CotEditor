<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th>Open documents in tabs</th>
		<td>Choose when documents are opened in tabs instead of new windows:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Respect System Setting</strong>: Respect your setting for the ”Prefer tabs when opening documents” option in the Windows section in the Desktop &amp; Dock pane in System Settings.</li>
				<li><strong>Always</strong>: Always in tabs as long as more than one document is already opened.</li>
				<li><strong>Automatically</strong>: Only when you’re working in full screen, or multiple documents are opened at once.</li>
				<li><strong>Manually</strong>: Only when explicitly open in tabs.</li>
			</ul></td>
