<h1>Insert text from camera in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>You can insert text in the real-world to the editor by taking a photo with your nearby iPhone or iPad.</p>


<p>To insert text by taking a photo, follow the instructions below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make sure your device (iPhone or iPad) is turned on and your Mac find it.</li>
	<li>From the Edit menu or the context menu in the editor, choose Insert from iPhone or iPad, and select the method to take a photo.</li>
	<li>The Camera app opens on the device you selected. Take a photo with your device:<ul>
		<li><strong>Take Photo</strong> command: Take a photo of the text to insert in the Camera app, and confirm it by tapping the Use Photo button.</li>
		<li><strong>Scan documents</strong> command: Place your document in view of the camera and wait for the scan to finish (You can also capture it manually). Drag the corners to adjust the scan to fit the page, and then confirm it by tapping the Keep Scan button and Save button in succession. Note that although the Scan Documents command allows to import multiple photos as a single document, CotEditor recognizes only the first one even if you import multiple photos.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>After the picture is chosen in your device, it shows up in your CotEditor on Mac. If any text is detected in the picture, all the detected texts are highlighted in the view.</li>
	<li>To insert the detected text to the insertion point in the editor, click the Insert button below the picture.</li>
</ol>

<p>This feature uses the Continuity Camera feature by Apple. To check the requirements for using the Continuity Camera feature on your Mac, see the Apple Support article: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209037" rel="external">Use your iPhone or iPad to scan documents or take a picture on your Mac</a>.</li>
