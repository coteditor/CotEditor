commercial products free of charge, however distributing modified copies\
requires that you clearly mark them as having been modified by you, while\
maintaining the original markings and copyrights. I don't like getting bug\
reports about code I wasn't involved in.\
\
I'd also appreciate if you gave credit in your app's about screen or a similar\
place. A simple "Thanks to M. Uli Kusterer" is quite sufficient.\
Also, I rarely turn down any postcards, gifts, complementary copies of\
applications etc.
