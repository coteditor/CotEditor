<h1>CotEditor crashes</h1>
<p>In the case you are using ATOK, Shift-Return, which is one of the CotEditor's default key bindings, would conflict with ATOK's key binding and cause an application crash.<br />
To solve this problem, you need to change the key binding of ATOK or CotEditor.<br />
 =&gt; <a href="../pgs/pref_keybinding.html">Key Bindings preferences</a></p>
<hr />
<p>If you get frequent crashes of CotEditor under certain circumstances, please send a crash log on the following page:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/coteditor/CotEditor/issues">Issues coteditor/CotEditor -github</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you send a crash log, don't forget to include the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The operation you performed just before the crash.</li>
  <li>Your environment information such as the version of OS, the version of CotEditor, your machine model, and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can display a crash log by clicking Report in the dialog which appears on the crash. (There is no point to send the crash log to Apple, so just close the window after copying the log.)</p>
