<h1>Change Window settings in CotEditor</h1>

<p>In the CotEditor app <img class="appicon" src="../../Shared/gfx/icon_16x16@2x.png" height="16" alt=""/> on your Mac, use Window settings to customize the default window appearance such as window size or line number display. To change these settings, choose CotEditor &gt; Settings, then click Window.</p>


<table class="settings">
<thead>
	<tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
	<tr>
		<th>Prefer Tabs</th>
		<td>Choose when documents are opened in tabs instead of new windows:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Respect System Setting</strong>: Respect your setting in the Desktop &amp; Dock pane in System Settings.</li>
				<li><strong>Always</strong>: Always in tabs as long as more than one document is already opened.</li>
				<li><strong>Automatically</strong>: Only when you’re working in full screen, or multiple documents are opened at once.</li>
				<li><strong>Manually</strong>: Only when explicitly open in tabs.</li>
			</ul></td>

	</tr>
	
	<tr>
		<th>Overscroll</th>
