<h1>Find inconsistent line endings in CotEditor</h1>

<p>CotEditor automatically detects line endings inconsistent with the document line ending setting. Inconsistent line endings can cause problems in various ways, such as running a script.</p>


<h2>Detect line endings in the file</h2>

<p>CotEditor automatically inspects line endings in the document when loaded, and set the common line ending type to the document line ending.</a>

<p>At the same time, if there are multiple types of line endings in the document, CotEditor alerts about it. In the dialog, you can then choose whether to convert all those inconsistent line endings to the most common line endings or leave them for now so that you can review them.</p>


<h2>Look over the location of inconsistent line endings</h2>

<p>The Warnings pane lists up all the line endings inconsistent with the document line ending.</p>


<p>To show the Warnings pane:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose View &gt; Inspector &gt; Warnings.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Find inconsistent line endings in the editor</h2>

<p>When the visibility setting of the line endings is selected, the inconsistent line endings are drawn in a different color. See <a href="howto_display_invisibles.html">Display invisible characters</a> for instruction on how to change the line endings visibility.</p>


<h2>Normalize line endings</h2>

<p>You can convert all line endings including inconsistent ones to a single line ending type by selecting the document line ending in the Line Endings menu.</p>
