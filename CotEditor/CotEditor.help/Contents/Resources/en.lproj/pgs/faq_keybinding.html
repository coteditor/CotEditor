<h1>My own key bindings don't work as I expect</h1>

<p>If a key binding you set doesn't work properly chances are that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The key binding is already taken by another function.</li>
	<li>You have set the key binding in the Menu Key Bindings setting, but the same key binding exists in the Additional Text Key Bindings setting. In this case, the latter takes precedence.</li>
</ul>
