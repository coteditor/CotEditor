<h1>What's New in CotEditor 3.9</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Invisible characters with more accuracy</dt>
	<dd>The drawing method for <a href="../pgs/howto_display_invisibles.html">invisible characters</a> has been revamped so that the symbols are displayed in accurate and natural positions under a variety of environments, such as proportional fonts, right-to-left writing direction, and vertical text orientation. In addition, more information about invisibles, such as the width of the tab characters and whether the space is kind of no-breaking spaces, can now be known at a glance.</dd>
	
	<dt>Ok, this indentation scope ends here.</dt>
	<dd>It is now possible to draw indentation guide lines. To make it enable, turn on the “Show indent guides” option in the Appearance pane. You can then grasp the scope and level of each indentation easier.</dd>
	
	<dt>Faster, faster!</dt>
	<dd>Since the latter updates of CotEditor 3.8.x series including this CotEditor 3.9.0, CotEditor made a bunch of performance optimizations in various areas.</dd>
