<h1>What’s New in CotEditor 2.5</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>New “Unicode (UTF-8) with BOM” encoding</dt>
	<dd>No more suffering by the invisible UTF-8 BOM. Now, you can check from the toolbar whether your UTF-8 document has a BOM, and even switch between with and without it easily.</dd>
	
	<dt>Adding the execute permission from save panel</dt>
	<dd>As you can give the execute permission on the save panel, scripts can be run immediately after the creation without <code>chmod</code>.</dd>
	
	<dt>Smoother pinch-zoom</dt>
	<dd>The pinch-zoom becomes smoother and more intelligent. For instance, how about splitting editors and scale up just one side from them?</dd>
