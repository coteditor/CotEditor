<h1>What’s new in CotEditor 4.1?</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>More comfort in your daily language</dt>
	<dd>Turkish and British English localizations were added! Furthermore, the line number view location will be swapped to the right side when the writing direction is right to left. In addition to them, improved all expressions in all localized languages (again) to harmonize more with the latest macOS terminology.</dd>
	
	<dt>Fly around the outline of documents</dt>
	<dd>Large documents become easier to navigate. The filtering feature is added to the outline pane to find out your outline item from a huge list. Do you prefer the outline menu in the navigation bar? Then, you can now assign your favorite shortcut to access the outline menu in the navigation bar. Customize the shortcut for the "Open Outline Menu" command from the menu item key bindings preferences.</dd>
	
	<dt>Key bindings have gotten more freedom</dt>
	<dd>Now you can assign shortcut keys regardless including/excluding the Command key, that is required before.</dd>
	
	<dt>Monterey support</dt>
	<dd>Internal update to work well under the latest system.</dd>
