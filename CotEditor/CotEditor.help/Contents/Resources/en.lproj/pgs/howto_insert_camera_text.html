<h1>Insert text from camera in CotEditor</h1>

<p>You can insert text in real-world to the editor by taking a photo with your nearby iPhone or iPad.</p>


<p>To insert text by taking a photo, follow the instruction below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Make sure your device (iPhone or iPad) is turned on and your Mac find it.</li>
	<li>From the Edit menu or the context menu in the editor, choose Insert from iPhone or iPad, and select the method to take a photo.</li>
	<li>The Camera app opens on the device you selected. Take a photo with your device:<ul>
		<li><strong>Take Photo</strong> command: Take a photo of the text to insert in the Camera app, and confirm it by tapping the Use Photo button.</li>
		<li><strong>Scan documents</strong> command: Place your document in view of the camera and wait for the scan to finish (You can also capture it manually). Drag the corners to adjust the scan to fit the page, and then confirm it by tapping the Keep Scan button and Save button in sucession. Note that, although the Scan Documents command allows to import multiple photos as a single document, CotEditor recognizes only the first one even if you import multiple photos.</li>
