	<dt>iCloud document (finally)</dt>
	<dd>We know it’s kind of too late, but CotEditor now supports the iCloud document, so that CotEditor has a own space on iCloud, moves files to there easier, and can resolve a file modification conflict visually.</dd>

	<dd>Document sharing in CotEditor gets more feature.</dd>
