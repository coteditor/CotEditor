<h1>Using encoding declarations (charset=, encoding=, @charset) for auto-detection</h1>

<p>When both “Auto-Detect” and “Refer to encoding declaration” are activated in the Format preferences pane, CotEditor reads the following types of encoding declarations (if present) &mdash; charset=, encoding=, @charset &mdash; when opening a file. If written properly, these declarations will be used to determine the file's character encoding.</p>
<p>A declaration can be anywhere in the document, the one either in comment area or in a plain sentence is detected. When you want to use a phrase such as “charset=UTF-8” even though your document's encoding is not UTF-8, you need to put an actual encoding declaration prior to the phrase, or, turn off “Refer to encoding declaration” in the Format preferences.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The range to scan declarations is limited within 2,000 characters from the head of the document.</li>
	<li>To make auto-detection of character encoding work, you have to put an equal character (“=”, no other characters) right after “charset” or “encoding.”</li>
	<li>The encoding name which comes after “charset=” or “encoding=” can be without double-quotes (&quot;) around.</li>
	<li>In the case there are multiple encoding declarations in your document, CotEditor uses the first one to determine the character encoding.</li>
	<li>When the encoding is declared as Shift JIS (written like charset=&quot;Shift_JIS&quot;), CotEditor chooses the prioritized one (the upper one in the encoding list) between Japanese (Shift JIS) and Japanese (Shift JIS X0213).<br />
