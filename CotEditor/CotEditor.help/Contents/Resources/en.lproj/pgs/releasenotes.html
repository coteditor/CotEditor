<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
	<li><span class="label">High Sierra</span>: Workaround a system issue where editor views could occasionally not scroll to the end of the document under specific environments on macOS 10.13 High Sierra.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>for advanced users</strong>: This workaround may affect rendering performance by large size documents, because the workaround disables non-contiguous layout on High Sierra (The non-contiguous layout are still used on lower versions). The workaround will be removed in the future when the bug origin is resolved. You can forcibly enable non-contiguous layout support on High Sierra by setting the hidden default key <code>enableNonContiguousLayoutOnHighSierra</code> to <code>YES</code> in Terminal, although this key is actually for debug-use.</li>

	<li><span class="label">non-AppStore ver.</span>: Disable auto-update feature.
	<ul>
		<li>Since the <a href="https://sparkle-project.org" rel="external">Sparkle</a> framework which is a software update framework we use doesn’t support Sandboxed apps yet, the auto-update feature within CotEditor should be once disabled. The new behavior is: a notification window will be shown when a new release is available (as before), then you need to update CotEditor manually getting the new version from our web-site. Or, just migrate to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/coteditor/id1024640650?ls=1">Mac App Store version</a>.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class="label">non-AppStore ver.</span>: Add option to check pre-release versions.
	<ul>
		<li>New pre-releases are always subject to the update check no matter the user setting if the current running CotEditor is a pre-release version.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class="label">non-AppStore ver.</span>: Update Sparkle framework to version 1.11.0.</li>

</ul>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Revised coloring process on 10.4 or later and adopted RegexKitLite for regular expression search of the syntax coloring function, which made coloring speed about 1.5-4.0 times faster compared to version 0.9.3. (Note that there are slight differences between the new and old regular expression syntax. The default coloring rules are not affected by the differences. See “ReadMe-en.rtf” for more details.)</li>

	<li>Modified the item layout of the Get Info drawer.</li>
	<li>If the “Sync Find strings with other apps” option is turned on, the strings in the Find field are now all selected only when they are retrieved, and making CotEditor frontmost does not cancel the selection anymore.</li>
	<li>When closing the Edit Style sheet by pressing OK, a warning message is now displayed if some errors were detected.</li>
	<li>Placed the shortcut button for Help on each Preferences pane.</li>
	<li>When CotEditor Preferences is already opened, selecting “Preferences…” now just makes the Preferences window frontmost without centering it.</li>
	<li>CotEditor Preferences no longer shows the oval button in the top-right corner of the window (10.4 or later).</li>
	<li>Modified the look of the default Style Name on the Edit Style sheet.</li>

	<li>Fixed a bug where editing text erased the highlight.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where performing Unhighlight after highlighting colored strings erased the color.</li>
	<li>Fixed an Edit Style sheet issue where the “Set to Factory Defaults” button would become active incorrectly on 10.5.</li>
	<li>On 10.5, when you pressed “+” button on the Edit Style sheet the added item did not become instantly editable, now it does.</li>
	<li>After editing a syntax style in the Syntax preference an already opened document using that style will be re-colored when it is made frontmost, but all documents were actually re-colored regardless of their styles. This problem has been fixed.</li>
	<li>When CotEditor is not in front, selecting “New” or “Open…” from the Dock icon did not make the new window frontmost. This problem has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Fixed an image lag issue when changing the transparency of text view.</li>
	<li>When the window was split, changing the transparency of text view did not apply to all views. This problem has been fixed.</li>
