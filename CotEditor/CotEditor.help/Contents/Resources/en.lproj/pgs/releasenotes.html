The new behavior is: a notification window will be shown when a new release is available (as before), then you need to update CotEditor manually getting the new version from our web-site. Or, just migrate to the <a href="http://appstore.com/mac/CotEditor">Mac App Store version</a>.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><span class="label">non-AppStore ver.</span>: Add option to check pre-release versions.

<h2>Additions/Changes</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Revised coloring process on 10.4 or later and adopted RegexKitLite for regular expression search of the syntax coloring function, which made coloring speed about 1.5-4.0 times faster compared to version 0.9.3.

	<li>Modified the item layout of the Get Info drawer.</li>
	<li>If the “Sync Find strings with other apps” option is turned on, the strings in the Find field are now all selected only when they are retrieved, and making CotEditor frontmost does not cancel the selection anymore.</li>
	<li>When closing the Edit Style sheet by pressing OK, a warning message is now displayed if some errors were detected.</li>
	<li>Placed the shortcut button for Help on each Preferences pane.</li>

	<li>Fixed a bug where performing Unhighlight after highlighting colored strings erased the color.</li>
	<li>Fixed an Edit Style sheet issue where the “Set to Factory Defaults” button would become active incorrectly on 10.5.</li>
	<li>On 10.5, when you pressed “+” button on the Edit Style sheet the added item did not become instantly editable, now it does.</li>
	<li>After editing a syntax style in the Syntax preference an already opened document using that style will be re-colored when it is made frontmost, but all documents were actually re-colored regardless of their styles. This problem has been fixed.</li>
	<li>When CotEditor is not in front, selecting “New” or “Open...” from the Dock icon did not make the new window frontmost. This problem has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Fixed an image lag issue when changing the transparency of text view.</li>
