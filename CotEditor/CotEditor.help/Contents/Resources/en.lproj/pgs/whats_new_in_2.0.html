<h1>What’s New in CotEditor 2.0</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Coloring theme feature</dt>
	<dd>You can now store your color settings in themes and switch them easily.
	  You can also export &amp; distribute your own themes.</dd>
	
	<dt>Drastic performance improvements</dt>
	<dd>In this change, we made efforts to identify a bunch of performance
	  bottlenecks and to resolve them. You don’t get frustrated anymore on
	  typing or opening files in particular with large files. Hanging on opening
	  large files is also resolved.</dd>
	
	<dt>Toggling comment-out/uncomment</dt>
	<dd>Selected text can now be comment-outed/uncommented via short-cut (⌘/) or
	  toolbar. The comment delimiters can be defined in each syntax style file.</dd>
	
	<dt>More syntax highlighting colors</dt>
	<dd>New “types,” “attributes” and “variables” keywords were added to syntax
	  highlighting colors.</dd>
	
	<dt>New syntax style file format in YAML</dt>
	<dd>The syntax style file format was changed from plist to YAML. It makes
	  style file ca. 60% smaller and helps to make your syntax via your own
	  script.</dd>
	
	<dt>Yosemite support</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor works well on OS X Yosemite. The new application icon is also in
	  Yosemite style.</dd>
	
	<dt>More than 100 of improvements</dt>
	<dd>There are more and more nicely improvements for you. Check out the
	  <a href="../pgs/releasenotes.html">release notes</a> for details.</dd>
