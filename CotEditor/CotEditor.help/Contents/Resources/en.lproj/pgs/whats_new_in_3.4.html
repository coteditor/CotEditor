<dl>
	<dt>Apply multiple replacement rules at once</dt>
	<dd>Using the new feature called “Multiple Replacement”, you can batch process text replacement with a preset definition containing multiple replacement rules. Those definitions can also be saved to reuse later.</dd>

	<dd>Now, you can look over the auto-extracted document outline, which you might see in the navigation bar above the editor, in the sidebar inspector.</dd>
	
	<dt>Much easier regular expression pattern editing in find panel</dt>
	<dd>The new input fields in the find panel syntax-highlight their contents when the regular expression option is enabled. In addition, the input fields also recognize and handle brace pairs properly just like the main document editor does.</dd>
