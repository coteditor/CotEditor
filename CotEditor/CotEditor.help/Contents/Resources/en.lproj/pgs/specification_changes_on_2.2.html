<h1>Specification Changes on CotEditor 2.2</h1>

<p>CotEditor has been Sandboxed since version 2.2.0. It includes some specification changes from the previous versions in order to conform to the Sandbox rules. If you've used the legacy version before, you may need some manual migrations.</p>


<h2>User Settings Location</h2>
<p>The location of the general CotEditor settings moved from <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/</code> to <code>~/Library/Containers/com.coteditor.CotEditor/Data/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/</code>. This migration will be automatically done on the first launch of CotEditor 2.2.0.</p>


<h2>Scripts Folder Location</h2>
<p>The location of the scripts folder moved from <code>~/Library/Application Support/CotEditor/ScriptMenu/</code> to <code>~/Library/Application Scripts/com.coteditor.CotEditor/</code>. <strong>Users need to migrate their script to the new folder manually</strong>, since CotEditor doesn't have the write permission to the new location.</p>


<h2><code>cot</code> Command-Line Tool Location</h2>
<p>The location of <code>cot</code> command moved from <code>CotEditor.app/Contents/MacOS/</code> to <code>CotEditor.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/</code>. <strong>Users who have already installed <code>cot</code> command need to re-install <code>cot</code> command-line tool manually</strong>. Go to “Integration” pane in the Preferences and just press “Uninstall/Install” button twice.</p>
