<h1>What’s New in CotEditor 3.0</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Swift migration</dt>
	<dd>All of the source codes for CotEditor was completely rewritten in Swift from Objective-C.</dd>
	
	<dt>Tabbed window</dt>
	<dd>Finally, CotEditor now supports tabbing windows on Sierra. On CotEditor 3.0, the tab behavior was improved from the standard Sierra implementation in order to let it behave more naturally.</dd>
	
	<dt>Brushed-up look</dt>
	<dd>Graphic images like toolbar icons and application icon were also updated to get a more modern look.</dd>
	
	<dt>New text search engine</dt>
	<dd>The find panel’s regular expression engine was changed from Onigmo (Oniguruma-mod) to the ICU library. Thanks to that, the line-up of text search is updated with new useful items and not only for the regex search but also for the normal texture search.</dd>
	
	<dt>Support macOS Sierra</dt>
	<dd>Hello to Sierra and good-bye to Mountain Lion and Mavericks. So, CotEditor now supports from OS X 10.10 to macOS 10.12.</dd>
