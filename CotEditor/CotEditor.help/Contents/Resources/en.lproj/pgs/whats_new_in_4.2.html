<h1>What’s New in CotEditor 4.2</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Treat line endings with every courtesy</dt>
	<dd>Now, CotEditor can handle documents with multiple types of line endings in the true sense. When line endings are inconsistent in a document, CotEditor lets you know and marks them where they are.</dd>
	
	<dt>Printing where you need</dt>
	<dd>The print dialog got the option Selection to the Pages section. It enables printing only the selected text in the document.</dd>
	
	<dt>Work among multiple machines</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor now supports Handoff to continue working on iCloud documents with a different machine easier. You can also transfer user settings such as syntax definitions to CotEditor on another machine by dropping via Universal Control.</dd>
