<h1>What's New in CotEditor 2.2</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Available in the Mac App Store</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor 2.2 is released on the Mac App Store. The system-integrated version management makes easier keeping your CotEditor up to date. You can also continuously get a non-AppStore version to manage it with Cask or something.</dd>
	  
	<dt>Sandboxing</dt>
	<dd>As the App Sandbox guarantees the prohibition of malicious behaviors at the system level, CotEditor became a more reliable OS X application than ever before. The non-AppStore version is also sandboxed.</dd>
	
	<dt>Improvements for the vertical text orientation</dt>
	<dd>Printing document in vertical orientation, displaying line number also on the vertical text mode, or even saving the text orientation state in the document file. Now you can more comfortably edit your text in the vertical orientation.</dd>
	
	<dt>Faster syntax highlighting</dt>
	<dd>The syntax highlighting becomes further faster and more nicely.</dd>
	
	<dt>Print feature improvement</dt>
	<dd>Other than the vertical text print, the print feature has been improved, for instance, to change page settings in the print panel, to store CotEditor's own print settings to the system print preset.</dd>
