<h1>What’s New in CotEditor 2.4</h1>

<dl>
	<dt>Improve text finder</dt>
	<dd>CotEditor re-implemented text find actions by own code. More sophisticated and integrated UI makes your text search process much more intuitive.</dd>
	
	<dt>Brackets and quotes balancing</dt>
	<dd>For instance, typing <code>{</code> inserts the corresponding <code>}</code> then moves the cursor into the brackets automatically. The feature helps reduce bothering cursor movement and contributes to your smart coding.</dd>
	
	<dt>Clickable URL links in documents</dt>
	<dd>This new option detects URL strings in your documents and provides them as clickable &amp; quick-lookable links.</dd>
	
	<dt>Better detection on the file opening</dt>
	<dd>We reviewed the previous file detection code and improved the precision of the encoding detection. Furthermore, CotEditor 2.4 alerts about a file that isn’t obviously a text file in order to avoid unwanted hang-up.</dd>
