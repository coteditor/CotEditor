<h1>Customizing syntax coloring rules</h1>

<p>Syntax coloring rules are determined by the following settings:</p>

<table>
	<tr><th>RE</th><td>If this option is selected, both Begin-string and End-string will be considered as regular expressions (RE stands for Regular Expression).</td></tr>
	<tr><th>IC</th><td>If this option is selected, case will be ignored during the search (IC stands for Ignore Case). For example, if you set “abc” as Begin-string and check IC, “ABC” or “abc” or “Abc” in your document will be matched.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Begin String</th><td>A string which denotes the beginning of the search pattern. This is required in order to search the code elements you want to be colored.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>End String</th><td>A string which denotes the end of the search pattern. This can be left blank.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Description</th><td>You can use this field to leave a comment about the term. Description doesn't affect to syntax highlighitng. This can be left blank.</td></tr>
</table>

<ul>
	<li>A definition whose Begin-string is blank will be ignored.</li>
	<li>A definition whose End-string is blank and RE is turned off will be used for defining the completion list as well.</li>
	<li>The RE setting affects both Begin-string and End-string, which means they should be written in regular expression or plain form both together.</li>
</ul>
